            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Tags, both predefined and custom, can be assigned to images, and stored either as image metadata
                (where the file format allows), sidecar files, or in directory metadata files. Keywords and comments
                can also be assigned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Basic editing in the form of lossless 90/180-degree rotation and flipping is supported; external
                programs such as GIMP, Inkscape, and custom scripts using ImageMagick can be linked to allow further
                processing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Advanced searching is available using criteria such as filename, file size, age, image dimensions,
                similarity to a specified image, or by keywords or comments. If images have GPS coordinates embedded,
                you may also search for images within a radius of a geographical point.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Geeqie supports applying the colour profile embedded in an image along with the system monitor
                profile (or a user-specified monitor profile).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Geeqie sessions can be remotely controlled from external software, so it can be used as an
                image-viewer component of a bigger application.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Geeqie includes a 'find duplicates' tool which can compare images using a variety of criteria
                (filename, file size, visual similarity, dimensions, image content), either within a single folder or
                between two folders. Finding duplicates ignoring the rotation of images is also supported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Images may be given a rating value (also known as a "star rating").</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maps from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> may be displayed in a side panel.
                If an image has GPS coordinates embedded, its position will be displayed on the map - if Image
                Direction is encoded, that will be displayed also. If an image does not have embedded GPS coordinates,
                it may be dragged-and-dropped onto the map to encode its position.</p>
            </li>
