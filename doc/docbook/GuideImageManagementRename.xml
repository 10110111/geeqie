          <para>To automatically rename the files in the list, enable the Auto rename check box. The dialog will change to batch mode for numerical naming of files.</para>
          <para>The file name list will change to include a preview column that will show the resulting name of each file. The text entry will change to three entries; the first represents the text that appears in the new names before the number, the second will be the start number to use when incrementing the file number, and the third represents the text to append to the name after the number. The end text should include the file name extension, therefore batch renaming multiple types of files (those with different extensions) all at once is not recommended.</para>
          <para>The padding number can be used to change the minimum length of characters to use for the number portion of the new name. When the file number results in fewer characters than the padding size, the result will be padded with leading zeros to fill the remaining space. For example if padding size is 3, a file with the number 24 will appear in the file name as “024”.</para>
          <para>The order of the file list can be changed by dragging a name to the desired location within the list. The preview column will update to reflect the new order.</para>
          <para>
            When the preview of new names is satisfactory, press
            <keycap>Enter</keycap>
            or activate the Rename button to rename the files to match the name in the preview column. Press
            <keycap>Escape</keycap>
            or activate the Cancel button to close the dialog and abort the rename operation.
