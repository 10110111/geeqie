Comparing images side-to-side

Menu: View/Split/...
View/Connected Scroll
View/Connected Zoom

File marks

Each image can be marked with up to 6 different
flags, it is possible to convert marks to selection and vice versa,
even boolean operations are supported
Note: marks are visible in file list and fullscreen mode with info,
they are not visible in icon list (yet).

Menu: Select/Show Marks
Select/Mark ...

File grouping

It is possible to group files which have the same name and different extension,
and show them as one entry. Typical usage: raw + jpeg, raw + xmp.

Configuration: Preferences/Filtering

External commands

It is possible to replace internal copy/move/delete operations with
external commands, for example create hardlinks instead of copying files.

External editors handling was improved, it is possible to run an editor
on the best fitting file type, and the exit status is reported back
to Geeqie.

Configuration: Preferences/Editors
Menu: Edit/...


Controls redesign

Most of controls was added to menu and is handled via keyboard accelerators,
thus they can be configured in ~/.geeqie/accels

The default function of keys 1, 2, 3, ... was changed from zoom to mark toggle and
function of <ctrl>1, <ctrl>2, <ctrl>3, ... from external editor to selecting mark.

Exiv2 support

Geeqie can be optionally linked with exiv2 to improve support for image metadata.
Details are at http://geeqie.wiki.sourceforge.net/Exiv2

    * Honor selection while fullscreen navigation (patch by Uwe Ohse).
    * Make properties tabs reorderable through drag'n drop (patch by Laurent Monin).
